genre: Fiction
description: "In her critically acclaimed debut, National Book Award finalist Min Jin Lee introduces the indelible Casey Han: a strong-willed, Queens-bred daughter of Korean immigrants who is addicted to a glamorous Manhattan lifestyle she cannot afford. Fresh out of Princeton with an economics degree, no job, and a popular white boyfriend, Casey is determined to carve a space for herself in the glittering world she craves-but at what cost?"
_description: >-
  “It would be remarkable if she had simply written a long novel that was as easy
  to devour as a 19th-century romance — packed with tales of flouted parental
  expectations, fluctuating female friendships and rivalries, ephemeral (and
  longer-lasting) romantic hopes and losses, and high-stakes career gambles. But
  Lee intensifies her drama by setting it against an unfamiliar backdrop: the
  tightly knit social world of Korean immigrants, whose children strive to blend
  into their American foreground without clashing with their distinctive
  background. It’s a feat of coordination and contrast that could kill
  a chameleon, but Lee pulls it off with conviction.”

    copy_markdown: 'In her first novel, *Free Food for Millionaires*, Min Jin Lee largely succeeds in unraveling the story of postcollege, Korean immigrant Casey Han, who is still challenged by her family traditions while striving for acceptance and personal fulfillment in the largely assimilated world of New York high finance. As the main character’s life unfolds, Lee masterfully reveals the fallible interpersonal relationships that define Han’s struggle. She also manages to tell the story from multiple perspectives, allowing the characters richness and authenticity that is often missing in the single point of view.'

Casey Han’s parents, who live in Queens, are Korean immigrants working in a dry cleaner, desperately trying to hold on to their culture and their identity. Their daughter, on the other hand, has entered into rarified American society via scholarships. Free Food for Millionaires offers up a fresh exploration of the complex layers we inhabit both in society and within ourselves and examines maintaining one’s identity within changing communities.
