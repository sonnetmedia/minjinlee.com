reviews:

    *Blue Plate Special*
  copy_markdown: "*Pachinko* is elegant and soulful, both intimate and sweeping. This
    story of several generations of one Korean family in Japan is the story of every
    family whose parents sacrificed for their children, every family whose children
    were unable to recognize the cost, but it's also the story of a specific cultural
    struggle in a riveting time and place. Min Jin Lee has written a big, beautiful
    book filled with characters I rooted for and cared about and remembered after
    I'd read the final page."

  copy_markdown: A deep, broad, addictive history of a Korean family in Japan enduring
    and prospering through the 20th century.
- attribution: Gary Shteyngart, New York Times bestselling author of *Little Failure*
    and *Super Sad True Love Story*
  copy_markdown: Astounding. The sweep of Dickens and Tolstoy applied to a 20th century
    Korean family in Japan. Min Jin Lee's *Pachinko* tackles all the stuff most good
    novels do—family, love, cabbage—but it also asks questions that have never been
    more timely. What does it mean to be part of a nation? And what can one do to
    escape its tight, painful, familiar bonds?
- attribution: Erica Wagner, author of *Ariel's Gift* and *Seizure*
  copy_markdown: If proof were needed that one family's story can be the story of
    the whole world, then *Pachinko* offers that proof. Min Jin Lee's novel is gripping
    from start to finish, crossing cultures and generations with breathtaking power.
    *Pachinko* is a stunning achievement, full of heart, full of grace, full of truth.

    *Half a Life* and *Chang & Eng*
  copy_markdown: Pachinko by Min Jin Lee is a great book, a passionate story, a novel
    of magisterial sweep. It’s also fiendishly readable—the real deal. An instant
    classic, a quick page-turner, and probably the best book of the year.

    and the Madman* and *Korea: A Walk through the Land of Miracles*'
  copy_markdown: Both for those who love Korea, as well as for those who know no more
    than Hyundai, Samsung and kimchi, this extraordinary book will prove a revelation
    of joy and heartbreak. I could not stop turning the pages, and wished this most
    poignant of sagas would never end. Min Jin Lee displays a tenderness and wisdom
    ideally matched to an unforgettable tale that she relates just perfectly.

  copy_markdown: Lee makes it impossible not to develop tender feelings towards her

    engagements with identity, family, vocation, racism, and class are guaranteed
    to provide your most affecting sobfest of the year. (Maria Cristina Garcia Lynch)

  copy_markdown: PACHINKO is about paying dues to a forgotten history; to the complex
    and fraught Japan-Korea relationship that endured well into the 90s and lingers
    to this day. But it doesn't wear its heart—or historical truths—on its sleeve.
    What drives this novel is the magisterial force of Lee's characterization; her
    ability to ground the narrative deeply and intimately in the details of daily
    life. Also threaded through it are questions of home, identity, nationhood and
    tradition—including the belief of its female protagonists that 'a woman's lot
    is to suffer.'

  copy_markdown: Through it all is a message about love, faith, and the deep-rooted
    bonds of family. Min Jin Lee gives us a phenomenal story about one family's struggle
    that resonates with us today. It will take hold of you and not let go!

PACHINKO follows one Korean family through the generations, beginning in early 1900s Korea with Sunja, the prized daughter of a poor yet proud family, whose unplanned pregnancy threatens to shame them all. Deserted by her lover, Sunja is saved when a young tubercular minister offers to marry and bring her to Japan.

So begins a sweeping saga of an exceptional family in exile from its homeland and caught in the indifferent arc of history. Through desperate struggles and hard-won triumphs, its members are bound together by deep roots as they face enduring questions of faith, family, and identity.
