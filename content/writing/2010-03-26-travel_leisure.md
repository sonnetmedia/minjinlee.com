[![image](/uploads/Picture_2_thumb.png)](/uploads/Journal.pdf) An essay on my complicated issues about traveling appears in TRAVEL + LEISURE (Southeast Asia) in the April 2009 issue. It was surprisingly funny to brood on my anxieties about leaving the house. In the process of writing this essay, I figured out that I love the learning and seeing bits of travel even more than my consuming fear of the unknown.

My T+L editors were Chris Kucway, Paul Ehrlich & Matt Leppard.
