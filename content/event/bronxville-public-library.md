The Friends of the Bronxville Public Library (FOBPL) are encouraging book clubs to read Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko, a finalist for the National Book Award, a national bestseller and a New York Times Editor’s Choice, in preparation for a special conversation with the author that will take place on the evening of Tuesday, January 23, 2018 at 7 PM at the Sommer Center for Worship and Performing Arts at Concordia College. Min Jin Lee will be interviewed by Bronxville’s Sissel McCarthy, Distinguished Lecturer and Director of the Journalism Program, Hunter College, and the audience will participate in a book discussion. Copies of Pachinko are available at Wormath's Book Shop in Bronxville and at the event.
