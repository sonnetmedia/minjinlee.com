A Conversation with author Will Schwalbe.

> <div><p>Will Schwalbe has worked in publishing (currently with Macmillan); in new media (as founder of&nbsp;<a href="http://cookstr.com/">cookstr.com</a>), and as a journalist. &nbsp;His previous book,&nbsp;<em>The End Of Your Life Book Club</em>, spent twelve weeks on the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestseller list in hardcover and paperback. He is also the author with David Shipley of&nbsp;<em>Send: Why People Email So Badly and How to Do It Better</em>. His newest title,&nbsp;<em>Books for Living</em>, describes the role that books can play in our lives and shows how a few specific books that Schwalbe champions can help us live each day more fully and with more meaning. Wil graduated from Yale in 1984 with a B.A. in Classical Civilization.&nbsp;</p></div>
