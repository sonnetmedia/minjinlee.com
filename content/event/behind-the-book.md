A Reading to support the literacy nonprofit Behind the Book.&nbsp;

Behind the Book is a small literacy nonprofit that gets kids excited about reading by connecting them with contemporary writers and illustrators. &nbsp;Working with low-income students in the 1st-12th grades, we bring authors and their books into individual classrooms in curriculum-based programs that incorporate direct and sustained interaction between students and authors. &nbsp; In workshop fashion, students do original writing; in elementary school, students create illustrated books. &nbsp;All students receive copies of authorsâ€™ books to keep as their own. &nbsp;Our goal is to build a new generation of readers and writers. Authors in the classroom have included Andr&eacute; Aciman, Russell Banks, Geoffrey Canada, Staceyann Chin, Suheir Hammad, Margo Jefferson, Maira Kalman, Colum McCann, Francine Prose, Jonathan Lethem, Brian Selznick, Hannah Tinti, Toure, Mo Willems, Rita Williams-Garcia, and Jacqueline Woodson, among scores of other acclaimed and prize-winning authors.
