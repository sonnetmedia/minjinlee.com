Women of Letters is everyone’s favorite literary salon!

Every month, New York’s best and brightest women come together on stage to celebrate the lost art of letter writing. Expect laughter, tears, and camaraderie as host Sofija Stefanovic welcomes guests reading “A letter to my taboo”. Together on stage for the first time ever:

Bestselling writer and author of Pachinko MIN JIN LEE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

Acclaimed comic, writer, and host of NPR’s Ask Me Another OPHIRA EISENBERG

Cult-favorite comedian JO FIRESTONE

Critically-acclaimed author of The Last Illusion POROCHISTA KHAKPOUR

Legendary musician and member of The Juan MacLean and LCD Soundsystem NANCY WHANG

Criminal justice advocate and founder of Project Liberation IVY WOOLF-TURK

The show attracts guests of the highest caliber, from all disciplines. Women of Letters veterans include: Molly Ringwald, Elaine Welteroth, Jean Grae, Kathleen Turner, Margo Jefferson, Martha Wainwright, Aparna Nancherla, Siri Hustvedt, Edie Falco, Susan Orlean, Emma Straub, Alexis Okeowo, Sonia Manzano, &nbsp;Eileen Myles, Suki Kim, Tavi Gevinson, Yael Stone, Amber Tamblyn and many more.

Proceeds from Women of Letters shows are regularly donated to charity, with over $750,000 being raised globally to date. October 5th’s proceeds will be donated to Millay Colony, an organization that helps to promote the vitality of the arts and the development of writers, visual artists, and composers by providing a retreat for creative work.www.millaycolony.org

“In our world which is becoming increasingly more disconnected by dependency on social media and our tendencies to live online, I feel that projects like Women of Letters are the antidote. Bringing people together in one room to hear people tell their stories is a powerful reminder of our humanity” — Molly Ringwald

“Women of Letters is the perfect alchemy of literary art-party and storytelling, with drinking and bonding for all genders of truth-seekers. Marieke and Michaela deserve a medal for creating this happening while we're on earth.”— Amanda Palmer

“You'll bond with some crazy-talented women over diverse passions, intimate struggles, and of course, drinks.” — BUST Magazine
