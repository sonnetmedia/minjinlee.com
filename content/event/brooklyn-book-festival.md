Whether a novel is set in the 1800s or the 2000s, its charactersâ€™ attitudes, actions, and behaviors reflect the particular period in history. Writers Jeffrey Renard Allen (Song of the Shank), Kia Corthron (The Castle Cross the Magnet Carter), and Min Jin Lee (Pachinko) discuss the challenges they faced when offering a new perspective on specific historical moment. Moderated by Isaac Fitzgerald, books editor at Buzzfeed.
