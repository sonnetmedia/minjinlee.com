The end of the year is a natural time to reflect, to take stock. Consequently, there are many "best of" lists this time of year: best movies, best tv, best albums, and best books. These lists are validating  when they include things we loved, and useful for making future plans: movies to see, tv to watch, music to check out, and books to read.

"Best" is a controversal term for librarians because we believe that any book you enjoy reading is a good book for you. There are no "good books" or "bad books" and it would follow, no "best books." However, we are a staff of readers, working in the service of New York City's readers, and we read some books published this year that we loved—and we want to list them!

We are an institution built on the principal of free and open access for all, so in keeping with that democratic spirit,  we put it to a vote.  We asked our staff to send us titles they read, published between January and December 2017, that they feel deserve a place on a top 10 list. The results were as broad and diverse as our collections, but there were ten titles many agreed were very special. Without further ado, NYPL's Top 10 Books of 2017.

Pachinko by Min Jin Lee

A sweeping family saga and historical fiction that tells the story of on Korean family who moves to Japan in the early 1900s.
