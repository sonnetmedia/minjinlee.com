Tonight, Amanda throws candy at the crowd, it being so close to Halloween and all. And then she is bench-pressed by Benjamin Percy. All wince as Roy Kesey waxes his legs as a performance art/act of protest against the Bush administration. And Min Jin Lee lightens it up a bit by telling us a dirty joke while balancing a spoon â€” on her nose. They all also read engagingly, even enticingly, and the music is by Max Gabriel.

[The Happy Ending Reading Series](http://www.happyendingseries.blogspot.com "The Happy Ending Reading Series") is curated by [Amanda Stern](http://www.amandastern.com "Amanda Stern").
