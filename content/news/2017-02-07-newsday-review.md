PACHINKO, by Min Jin Lee. This historical novel, by the author of “Free Food for Millionaires,” follows several generations of a Korean family in Japan during the 20th century, where they face poverty and intense discrimination but make a fortune running pachinko parlors, a pinball-like game. Lee has worked her own Asian variation on the immigrant saga. (Grand Central, $27)
