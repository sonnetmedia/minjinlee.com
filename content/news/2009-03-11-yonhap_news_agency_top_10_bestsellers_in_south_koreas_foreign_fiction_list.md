A profile of my work appeared this month in the Yonhap News—South Korea’s official news agency. I was interviewed by the journalist Shin Hae-in of Yonhap.

The interview begins… “She was once cast in with that sea of would-be authors, struggling to find a publisher for her debut novel: a lengthy, dense work full of complex characters that might intimidate even the most voracious reader.

Now, people call her the “21st century Jane Austen,” and Lee Min-jin has become one of the few Korean-American writers to have their book translated into the language of their parents.”

This version of the Yonhap story ran in the Joongang Ilbo—the Korean partner paper of the International Herald Tribune: [Joongang Ilbo](http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2902102).
