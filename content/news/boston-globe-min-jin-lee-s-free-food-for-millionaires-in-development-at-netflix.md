> "_Pachinko_ is a tale of immigration within a different context than stories of coming to the U.S. The multigenerational epic follows a Korean family who moves to Japan in the early 1900s. Their roots in Korea follow them, as they remain in a society that labels them outsiders, and estranged from their country of origin."
