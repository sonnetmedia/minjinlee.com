I read at least a book a week for the radio programme, so after a while they all blur a bit, but there are a few that stick in my mind. The first is a big doorstop of a book called Pachinko, (Head of Zeus, €11.70) by Min Jin Lee, a Korean-American author. It's a multi-generational saga and a wonderful story. Of all the books that I've read this year, it's the one that springs to mind, as a great read, and an unexpected one. Another one that comes to mind is Gail Honeyman's Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine (HarperCollins, €16.90). This was one of the books that we selected for our Eason Book Club. It's about a woman who's on the spectrum, it would appear, but she has been through a trauma which is only revealed in trickles throughout the narrative until we finally get a full picture of her life. It's a tale of redemption.

The third one that I would say was a surprise was The End of Eddy, (Vintage, €16.90) by Edouard Louis. It's an autobiography. Eddy is a young, working-class kid growing up in industrial France, and he's highly put upon by his father, who mistreats him. He happens to be gay. He escapes from this milieu and writes this book. He is a sensation in France, to the point now that he is an academic in the Ecole National Superieure.
