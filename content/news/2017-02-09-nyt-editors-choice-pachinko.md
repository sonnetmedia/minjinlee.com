10 New Books We Recommend This Week:

This week brings some serious-minded nonfiction (Wall Street wrongdoing, covert wars, depression) and meaty fiction (an epic bildungsroman, border wars, a multigenerational immigrant saga) with a glamorous dose of diverting memoir from the actress and biographer Patricia Bosworth. Plus, a new book from Kevin Wilson, author of the beloved 2011 novel, “The Family Fang.” I’m especially heartened by the ambitious sweep of this week’s best fiction. There is nothing scaled-back or slight about the stories these writers set out to tell.

PACHINKO, by Min Jin Lee. (Grand Central, $27.) This stunning novel chronicling four generations of an ethnic Korean family in Japan is about outsiders and much more. A fascinating look at immigrant life among Koreans — and the prejudices they face — in Japan.
