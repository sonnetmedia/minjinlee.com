It began with more than 1,500 books.

With all the works submitted by publishers, the judges for this year's National Book Awards have had their hands (and bookshelves) full the past few months. But that daunting number of contenders winnowed further Wednesday, as the National Book Foundation announced the finalists for its literary prize — just five works each in four category: fiction, nonfiction, poetry and young people's literature.

You can find those shortlists below, paired with links to NPR's previous coverage for readers to get to know those nominees better.

For now, at least, there are two winners whose names we won't have to wait on: Annie Proulx, who has already won a National Book Award for The Shipping News, will be honored this year with the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the NBF's version of a lifetime achievement award. And Dick Robinson, president and CEO of Scholastic, will be receiving the Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community.

The rest of this year's winners will be announced on Nov. 15 in New York City.
