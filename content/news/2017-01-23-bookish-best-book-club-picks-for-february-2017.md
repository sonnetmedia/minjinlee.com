There’s something about generational sagas that we can’t get enough of. This novel by Min Jin Lee explores the history of Korea and Japan during the early 1900s through the family of a pregnant girl. With her baby’s father out of the picture, Sunja decides to accept a marriage proposal from a pastor, even though it means traveling with him to Japan. The move is isolating and painful; Sunja and her Korean family are discriminated against because of their homeland. The novel follows the family through four generations as they search for belonging in a new land.
