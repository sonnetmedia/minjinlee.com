Pachinko by Min Jin Lee. In a small fishing village on the banks of the East Sea, a club-footed older man marries a fifteen-year-old girl. The couple have one child, their revered daughter Sunja. But when years later Sunja falls pregnant by a married man, the family could face ruin. Isak, a Christian minister, steps in and offers her the chance of a new life in Japan as his wife. Following a man she barely knows, to a country where she has no friends and unable to even speak the language, is just the start of Sunja's story of survival, family, love and loyalty.
