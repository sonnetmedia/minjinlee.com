I had the chance to speak with Stig Abell and Thea Lenarduzzi about the books I reviewed for The Times Literary Supplement on its wonderful podcast. The segment on the literature about North Korea begins on 25.01.

Freedom, Books, Flowers & the Moon: May 25

With Stig Abell and Thea Lenarduzzi – TLS Philosophy editor Tim Crane grapples with the mind-body problem and “what it means to be the kind of creatures we are”, plus the year that brightened Nietzsche’s outlook, and Biscuit the dog’s self-consciousness; Korean American author Min Jin Lee on how Korean literature approaches the difficult dream of reunification and what a new collection of stories, The Accusation by the pseudonymous author “Bandi”, “the first work of fiction written by a North Korean author presumed still to be alive and living in the country”, tells us about life in that deeply mysterious land; finally, the great Alasdair Gray, author of Lanark, reads “From Vers Doré by Gérard de Nerval”, a new work first published in this week’s TLS.
