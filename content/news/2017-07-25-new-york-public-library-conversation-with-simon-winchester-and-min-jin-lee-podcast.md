&nbsp;

I had the distinct privilege of speaking with one of my favorite writers Simon Winchester at one of the greatest libraries in the world, the New York Public Library on 42nd Street. This conversation was introduced by the very cool Aidan Flax-Carter, the Manager of Public Programs at the NYPL. &nbsp;This podcast came out today.&nbsp;
