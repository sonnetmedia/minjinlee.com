Pachinko, a finalist for the National Book Award, follows four generations of a Korean family from 1910, when Japan annexed Korea, through most of the 20th Century. It begins with an aging fisherman and his wife, who run a boarding house in a village near the port city of Busan. Their son, who has a cleft palate and twisted foot, is married at last. When his teenage daughter Sunja becomes pregnant by a visiting businessman, a kind pastor marries her and takes her to Osaka. After he dies, Sunjaâ€™s grit keeps the family afloat during the tough war years. One son makes it into Waseda University. The youngest runs pachinko parlours, where gamblers play machines in a game similar to pinball. But their future is shadowed by past secrets and betrayals.
