The Weatherhead East Asian Institute is pleased to share an April 11, 2017 interview with Min Jin Lee, author of the acclaimed new novel Pachinko. During the interview, Ms. Lee discusses the experiences and research that led her to write the novel, which follows four generations of an ethnic Korean family living in Japan from 1910 to 1989.

Pachinko, published in February 2017 by Grand Central Publishing, is a national bestseller, a New York Times Editor’s Choice and an American Booksellers Association’s Indie Next Great Reads. “This stunning novel chronicling four generations of an ethnic Korean family in Japan is about outsiders and much more,” The New York Times Book Reviewstated. “A fascinating look at immigrant life among Koreans — and the prejudices they face — in Japan.”

Min Jin Lee went to Yale College where she was awarded both the Henry Wright Prize for Nonfiction and the James Ashmun Veech Prize for Fiction. She attended law school at Georgetown University and worked as a lawyer for several years in New York prior to writing full time. From 2007 to 2011, Ms. Lee lived in Tokyo, where she wrote Pachinko. She lives in New York City with her family.
