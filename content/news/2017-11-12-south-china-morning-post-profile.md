Min Jin Lee is having a good day in Hong Kong. It’s the Korean American writer’s birthday and she has just stepped off a flight from New York. She has the happy glow of someone who has been nominated for a top literary prize.

“The flight was 17 hours and I’ll be here less than 70 hours – half of them awake. I’m not even sure I’m awake now.
