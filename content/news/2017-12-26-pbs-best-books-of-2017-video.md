Pachinko by Min Jin Lee is a sprawling, beautiful novel chronicling the cultural struggles of four generations of a Korean family, beginning in 1910 during the time of Japanese colonization. In our interview with Lee at the 2017 Miami Book Fair, she reflected on the opening lines of her book, “History has failed us. But no matter.” Lee explains, “People who are powerless are affected by history and yet have to carry on because so many of us don’t sit at the tables in which decisions are made.”
