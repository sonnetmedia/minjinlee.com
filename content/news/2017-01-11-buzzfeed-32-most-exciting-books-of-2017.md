Min Jin Lee’s novel Pachinko is the portrait of one Korean family through multiple generations, from the early 1900s where prized daughter Sunja’s unexpected pregnancy threatens to bring shame to her poor family until a minister offers to marry her and start a new life together in Japan. Sunja’s descendants live in exile from their true homeland, and face (and rise above) all kinds of challenges, from poverty to discrimination, while establishing their identity and family in a new country.
