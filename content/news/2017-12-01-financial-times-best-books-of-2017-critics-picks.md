Selected by Nilanjana Roy, FT Columnist:

"History has failed us, but no matter." PACHINKO, Min Jin Lee's massive, richly wrought second novel, follows Sunja and her children across four generations, from a village in Busan to a ghetto for Korean immigrants in Japan. Sunja weds a pastor to cleanse the stain of her love affair with a charismatic married man. Her second son makes a fortune with pachinko parlours, but a character notes: 'Living everyday in the presence of those who refuse to acknowledge your humanity takes great courage.' One of 2017's most rewarding novels.
