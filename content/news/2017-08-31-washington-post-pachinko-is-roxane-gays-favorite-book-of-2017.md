The National Book Festival: the one day a year when a serious reader’s biggest problem isn’t that overflowing stack of books to get to. During the 10-hour event, more than 100 authors, illustrators and poets will give talks and sign their books. It’s a lot to take in, so we won’t judge if you’ve been busy finessing an Excel-sheet game plan (Elizabeth Strout or Don Winslow at 10 a.m.?). To help with your prep work, we chatted with seven of this year’s featured authors — including David Baldacci and the “Outlander” series’ Diana Gabaldon — about their talks and the books they’ve loved in 2017.

Roxane Gay
<br>Gay says she’ll be reading from “Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body,” which was released in June, and doing a Q&A about her work. In “Hunger,” she describes her rape as a young girl and her struggles with food, weight and self-image in her trademark arresting style. “I ate and ate and ate in the hopes that if I made myself big, my body would be safe,” she writes. “I buried the girl I was because she ran into all kinds of trouble.”

<br>Favorite 2017 book: The novel “Pachinko” by Min Jin Lee, which follows four generations of a poor Korean immigrant family in Japan.
