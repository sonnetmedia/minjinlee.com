What with the impending demise of net neutrality and social media turning into a toxic snake pit, you’re going to want to be spending a lot more time curled up with a book. Celebrate the end of a lousy year and the start of a probably lousier one by picking up a few of the 25 novels that Electric Literature staff and contributors voted as our favorites of 2017. With National Book Award finalists and winners as well as weird small-press offerings, we’ve got something for every taste.

Pachinko, Min Jin Lee

National Book Award finalist Pachinko is a family epic about Koreans in imperialist Japan. It’s a deeply-researched piece of historical fiction that still feels urgent, relevant, and full of human emotion.
