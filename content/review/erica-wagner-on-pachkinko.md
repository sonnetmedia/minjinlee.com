If proof were needed that one family's story can be the story of the whole world, then *Pachinko* offers that proof. Min Jin Lee's novel is gripping from start to finish, crossing cultures and generations with breathtaking power. *Pachinko* is a stunning achievement, full of heart, full of grace, full of truth.
