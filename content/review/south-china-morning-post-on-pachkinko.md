PACHINKO is about paying dues to a forgotten history; to the complex and fraught Japan-Korea relationship that endured well into the 90s and lingers to this day. But it doesn't wear its heart—or historical truths—on its sleeve. What drives this novel is the magisterial force of Lee's characterization; her ability to ground the narrative deeply and intimately in the details of daily life. Also threaded through it are questions of home, identity, nationhood and tradition—including the belief of its female protagonists that 'a woman's lot is to suffer.'
